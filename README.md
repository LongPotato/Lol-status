#Lol-status

This is a little program that I make for my favorite game: League of Legends. 

This program calls REST APIs from [Riot games](https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods) to retrieve information about servers and players status.

The GUI was built by using [Ruby Shoes](http://shoesrb.com) toolkit.

###Features:

* Quick check for server status.
* Get in game status, get info about champion and game length.
* Handsfree: Automatic checking every 3 minutes.
* Look up summoner profile from ['op.gg'](http://www.op.gg) or current game matchup at ['lolnexus'](http://www.lolnexus.com).
* Look up up to 5 summoners at a time.
* Save and load friendlists.

###Download:

* [Mac OS](http://1drv.ms/1EfUqid)
* [Windows](http://1drv.ms/1EfUvCy)

*First time installation may take serveral minutes. Require [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/downloads/) to interpret the pakage file (fyi).*

*Shoes installation is included in the package, so ya you don't need to do anything, just click and run.*

###Haw tu use dis 101:

* Choose your server everytime before a search. It needs to know which region your account belongs to, cus logic.

* Summoner search is case and space insensitive. That means you can freely type anything, no need to worry about spaces and capital letters in the name.

* Search up to 5 summoners. Well, you can type more than 5 but it will only display 5 lel. Use commas to separate summoners names.

* It's not freezing! It's LOADING!. Retrieving information from Rito's server takes time, so go grab a snack or something.

* Keep both windows open please! Handsfree needs both to run.

* Save your summoner names to a local text file for your convenience. The next time you fire up the program, just load in the file, no need to set up region or type in names! 

* Boom! sit back and handsfree stalking people ;)
